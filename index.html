                                    Sakhi Jan is closely associated with the Blue Mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. The Blue Mosque, also known as the Shrine of Hazrat Ali,
                                    is one of the most revered religious sites in Afghanistan. It is believed to be the burial place of Imam Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad.
                                    The mosque is famous for its striking blue-tiled architecture, 
                                    intricate designs, and peaceful surroundings. It is a significant pilgrimage site, 
                                    attracting visitors from across the region. Many people visit the shrine to seek blessings and pay their respects

                                <p>
                                    Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque, meaning "Mosque of the King of Two Swords," is a two-story yellow mosque located in Kabul, Afghanistan, near the Kabul River. Built during the reign of Amanullah Khan (1919–1929), it was modeled after the Ortaköy Mosque in Istanbul, giving it a unique architectural style that blends Islamic and European influences.
                                    Unlike traditional Afghan mosques, Shah-Do Shamshira features Italian decorative stucco, earning it the nickname "Afghan Baroque". The mosque stands out with its grand balconies, carved columns, and arched windows, making it one of the most visually distinct religious sites in Kabul.
                                    Historically, the mosque is linked to an Arab general who fought in Kabul centuries ago, inspiring its name. It has also witnessed significant events, including the tragic murder of Farkhunda Malikzada in 2015, which sparked national outrage. In June 2021, the mosque underwent full renovation, restoring its architectural beauty.

                                    The Minaret of Jam (Pashto and Dari: منار جام) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in western Afghanistan.
                                    It is located in a remote and nearly inaccessible region of the Shahrak District, Ghor Province, next to the Hari River. The 62 m (203 ft)[1] or 65 m (213 ft)[2] high minaret was built c.
                                    1190 entirely of baked bricks and is famous for its intricate brick, stucco and glazed tile decoration, which consists of alternating bands of kufic and naskhi calligraphy, geometric patterns,
                                    and verses from the Qur'an. Since 2002, the minaret has remained on the list of World Heritage in Danger, under serious threat of erosion, and has not been actively preserved.[3] In 2014, the BBC reported that the tower was in imminent danger of collapse
